CLC: OpenCL compiler and syntax checker
---------------------------------------

CLC is a small utility that allow you to compile OpenCL sources into precompiled
binaries. These binaries can then be loaded with clCreateProgramWithBinary.

The program is licensed with a new BSD style licence. Please see the LICENCE
file.

The main purpose is to be able to syntax check OpenCL files.

At the moment, it is not possible to specify multiple source files, and there
is no way to control preprocessor defines and include paths for the OpenCL
compiler. This may be fixed in the future as need arise.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
------------------

1. Edit the makefile, you may want to change the compiler (which defaults to
   clang). Most of all you want to change the CFLAGS variable to use the arch
   speciffic CFLAGS for your system.

2. Run make

3. Copy the clc binary to whatever place you want it installed in, there is
   no install command in the makefile; use cp instead.
